# 🩺 Health Care Monitor – A Smart Health Alert System

Hi! This is a simple health monitoring app I built using **Python** and **Streamlit**.  
It tracks basic vitals like heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, etc., and if anything looks dangerous (critical), it will automatically **send an email alert** to a doctor or caregiver.

It's a lightweight, real-time solution for health tracking – ideal for basic health dashboards or final year project ideas.
